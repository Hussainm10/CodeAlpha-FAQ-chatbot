Q: What is artificial intelligence?
A: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

Q: How does machine learning work?
A: Machine learning involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Q: What are neural networks?
A: Neural networks are algorithms modeled after the human brain that are used to recognize patterns and learn from data.

Q: Can you explain natural language processing?
A: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

Q: What is the purpose of a decision tree?
A: A decision tree is used for classification and regression tasks by splitting data into subsets based on input features to make decisions.

Q: How does supervised learning differ from unsupervised learning?
A: Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.

Q: What are convolutional neural networks used for?
A: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are primarily used for processing structured grid data, such as images, and are effective in image recognition tasks.

Q: What is the difference between overfitting and underfitting?
A: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, leading to poor generalization, while underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture underlying patterns.

Q: How does reinforcement learning operate?
A: Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions in an environment.

Q: What are some common applications of AI in daily life?
A: Common applications include virtual assistants, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and personalized advertisements.
